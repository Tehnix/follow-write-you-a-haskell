# Write you a Haskell Follow along
This repository contains code from following http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/.

Each milestone/chapter (whichever most fitting) will be separated into branches, so these can always be revisited later on, and if anyone wants to follow along in the progression through the chapters. Hopefully this will be somewhat educational also.

## Branches
- master : Will always represent the furthest status of the repository into the book.
- nanoparsec : Contains the NanoParsec parser from chapter 2 on parsers, along with tests for the parser.
